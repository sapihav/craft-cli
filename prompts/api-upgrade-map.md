## New Features to Implement

### 1. Whiteboards (NEW — 5 endpoints)

Excalidraw-format whiteboard management. This is the only entirely missing API surface.

```
craft whiteboards create --page PAGE_ID              # Create empty whiteboard
craft whiteboards get WHITEBOARD_ID                   # Get elements (Excalidraw format)
craft whiteboards add WHITEBOARD_ID --json '[...]'    # Add elements
craft whiteboards update WHITEBOARD_ID --json '[...]' # Update elements
craft whiteboards delete WHITEBOARD_ID --ids "id1,id2" # Remove elements
```

### 2. Collections Schema Update (verify coverage)
- `PUT /collections/{id}/schema` — may need new `craft collections schema update` subcommand

### 3. API Enhancements to Existing Commands

| Enhancement | Affected Commands | Details |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| `fetchMetadata=true` | `craft list`, `craft get` | Add `--metadata` flag to include createdAt, lastModifiedAt, etc. |
| `Accept: text/markdown` | `craft get` | Add `--accept markdown` for native markdown from blocks endpoint |
| Date filters | `craft list` | Add `--from` and `--to` date range flags |
| RE2 regex search | `craft search` | Add `--regex` flag and `--case-sensitive` |
| Max depth control | `craft get`, `craft blocks get` | Add `--max-depth` flag |

---

## Testing Plan

Test against: `https://connect.craft.do/links/HHRuPxZZTJ6/api/v1` (no auth required)

### Phase 1: Verify Existing Coverage
```bash
./craft-cli list
./craft-cli folders
./craft-cli search "test"
./craft-cli get <doc-id>
./craft-cli blocks get <doc-id>
./craft-cli collections
./craft-cli tasks
./craft-cli connection
```

### Phase 2: Test New Whiteboard Endpoints
```bash
# Create a whiteboard (need a page ID first)
./craft-cli whiteboards create --page <page-id>
./craft-cli whiteboards get <whiteboard-id>
./craft-cli whiteboards add <whiteboard-id> --json '[{"type":"rectangle","x":0,"y":0,"width":100,"height":100}]'
./craft-cli whiteboards update <whiteboard-id> --json '[{"id":"elem-id","x":50}]'
./craft-cli whiteboards delete <whiteboard-id> --ids "elem-id"
```

### Phase 3: Test Enhanced Parameters
```bash
./craft-cli list --metadata --from 2026-01-01 --to 2026-04-01
./craft-cli get <doc-id> --max-depth 2
./craft-cli search "pattern" --regex --case-sensitive
```

## Priority Order

1. **Verify existing coverage** against live API — some endpoints may have drifted
2. **Whiteboards** — only entirely missing surface
3. **fetchMetadata flag** — quick win, adds useful info
4. **Date filters** — useful for list command
5. **Max depth control** — useful for large documents
6. **Collections schema update** — verify and add if missing
